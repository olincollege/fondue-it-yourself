# Moitié-Moitié Fondue

This is a traditional "half-and-half" cheese based recipe that's popular in
Switzerland. This is typically served with cubed bread, with people using a
fondue fork to dip a cube of bread into the fondue and eating it.

This recipe makes two generous servings.

## Ingredients

- 16 oz (~450 g) crusty white bread (e.g., a baguette), cubed into bite-sized
  pieces
- 1 cup (~250ml) white wine (e.g., Sauvignon Blanc)
- 1 clove of garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons (~20 g) cornstarch
- 8 oz (~225 g) Gruyeres cheese, coarsely grated
- 8 oz (~225 g) Vacherin Fribourgeois cheese, coarsely grated (see note)
- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) kirsch (see note)
- Freshly ground pepper, to taste
- Freshly grated nutmeg, to taste

## Directions

1. Place the white wine and garlic in the pot, and sift/whisk the cornstarch
   into the mixture, taking care to avoid clumping.
2. Place the pot over medium low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture
   becomes thick and bubbly.
3. Add the cheese into the pot, stirring, until the cheese has melted into the
   mixture.
4. Stir in kirsch, pepper, and nutmeg, and heat gently for a few minutes.
5. Transfer the pot to a heating plate and serve.

## Notes

- Some traditional recipes call for day-old bread, as it tends to be a bit drier
  and absorb the fondue better. You can also try leaving the cubed bread out for
  a bit, but be aware that some bread will turn stale quite quickly this way.
- More traditional recipes tend to use a weaker garlic flavor, which they often
  do by cutting a clove in half and rubbing it all over the inside of the pot
  (but not otherwise using it in the fondue).
- The ratio of wine, garlic, cornstarch, and cheese above can vary widely
  between recipes - feel free to play around with it.
- Vacherin Fribourgeois cheese is _very_ hard to find in the US. It is also not
  the same as Vacherin Mont d'Or (sometimes just called Vacherin) - if it's a
  soft, Brie-like cheese, it's not the right one. Typical substitutes for
  Vacherin Fribourgeois are Challerhocker or Appenzeller, which are easier to
  find.
- Some people have noted that putting this much kirsch at the end of the cooking
  can make a somewhat boozy-tasting fondue. Feel free to reduce or eliminate
  this if you'd like.
- As the mixture continues to be heated, the oil of the cheese may separate. If
  this happens, adding extra cornstarch one tablespoon at a time can help bind
  the fondue back together.
